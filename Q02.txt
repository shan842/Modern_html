HTML entities are special codes or character references used to display reserved characters in HTML, such as <, >, and &, which might otherwise be interpreted as part of the HTML syntax. They also provide a way to include symbols and characters not present on a standard keyboard.

HTML entities are written as:

&entity_name; (e.g., &lt;)
&#entity_number; (e.g., &#60;)
