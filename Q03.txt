Accessibility in web development refers to designing and creating websites, tools, 
and technologies so that they can be used by all people, including those with disabilities. 


Why Accessibility is Essential

.Legal and Ethical Responsibility: Many countries have legal requirements (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act in the US, WCAG guidelines) mandating accessibility. Ethically, it ensures inclusivity and equal access to information and opportunities.

Improved User Experience: Accessibility often improves usability for all users by ensuring clear navigation, readable text, and intuitive design.


Benefits for Different User Groups

1. People with Disabilities
Visual Impairments: Screen readers can interpret accessible websites with proper semantic HTML, alt text for images, and sufficient color contrast.

2. Users in Challenging Situations
Accessibility features like captions can assist people watching videos in noisy environments.

3. People with Temporary Impairments
Users recovering from injuries (e.g., broken arm) or experiencing situational limitations (e.g., using a mobile device in bright sunlight) benefit from accessible design.
