Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements: Proper use of semantic HTML elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, <nav>, <section>, and <main> helps screen readers understand the structure of the page. This makes it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and comprehend the content.

2. Add Alt Text for Images: Always provide descriptive alt text (alt attribute) for images. This ensures that users who rely on screen readers can understand the content and context of the images.

3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as links, buttons, and form controls, are fully navigable and operable using the keyboard. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse and rely on keyboard navigation.
